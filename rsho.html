                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        This document serves as a handover guide for the Retrofit Scotland project, an energy solutions provider aiming to transition from manual, disparate processes to a unified, end-to-end workflow management system. The core objective is to solve the current problem of lost lead visibility and inefficient tracking by implementing a live, automated system. The proposed BigChange platform will provide a single source of truth for all project data, improving efficiency, compliance, and accountability from lead generation to job completion.

                        <li><strong>Manual Processes:</strong> The current system relies heavily on manual work, using a combination of Dropbox, Excel spreadsheets, and a third-party app called Service Mate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loss of Visibility:</strong> It is easy to lose track of leads, with a potential for 50-60 leads per month being lost due to a lack of live tracking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Real-Time Data:</strong> The Excel trackers only provide notes and don't offer a real-time, active reminder system for tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Centralized System:</strong> All different parts of the business—admin, submissions, surveyors, and installers—use separate platforms, which is inefficient and chaotic.</li>

                            <li><strong>20250826:</strong> The initial discovery call identified that Retrofit Scotland is a company similar to Union Technical. The company relies on manual processes using Dropbox, Excel, and an app called Service Mate, which leads to a loss of lead visibility and a chaotic workflow. The key pain point is the desire for a single, streamlined system with live tracking and reminders to manage leads from initial contact to completion. The team is also interested in a solution that can track key financial metrics like 'ABS score.'</li>
                            <li><strong>20250916:</strong> The follow-up playback session demonstrated a proof-of-concept system built on BigChange. The demo showed how leads are created as 'notes,' progress through a configurable workflow, and automatically generate a 'survey job' once qualified. Key features demonstrated included a mobile app for surveyors, automated email confirmations, and the ability to generate reports with photos and sign-offs directly from the system. It was clarified that the system is highly configurable and can be adapted to their specific needs. Discussions also touched on the per-user pricing model and the need for a separate discussion on the total number of licenses required.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold section-header-bg text-white p-3 rounded-lg mb-4">Proposed Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The proposed solution utilizes the BigChange platform to provide a comprehensive, integrated, and end-to-end workflow management system. The architecture is based on a series of interlinked jobs, notes, and custom automations. It addresses the client's pain points by providing a single source for managing leads, scheduling, and compliance. The workflow begins with a comprehensive 'ECO LEAD' note which, upon completion, automatically creates a survey job. This job includes configurable worksheets for surveyors to complete on-site, with mandatory steps for compliance. The system will also handle the generation of final reports and manage job submission to funders, providing real-time visibility throughout the entire lifecycle.

                                <li><strong>Scheduling Patterns:</strong> The system needs to support scheduling individual jobs (e.g., surveys) and group jobs (e.g., installation, with different resources for different parts of the job).</li>
                                <li><strong>Edge Cases/Complex Scenarios:</strong> The solution needs to handle scenarios where not all evidence is collected on the initial survey, and it should provide manual modification capabilities for worksheet answers.</li>
